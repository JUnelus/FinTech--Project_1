# FinTech Project 1

## Invest-a-Bull!

Discovering investment opportunities.

-	Offering service to invest and lend in cryptocurrencies along with the opportunity to invest in other products.
-	To minimize the risk and create a balance for our investors, we offer lending investment opportunity in cryptocurrency.
-	Our goal is to create balanced investment opportunity to our club members that is distinct from the traditional hedging investment opportunities. 

Details: 
We will create an investor calculator that will give the investors the options to choose up to 5 different investments options. Based on the weight, volatility & and other risk factors for each investment, our investment calculator will generate results and charts that will indicate the risk for diluted investments and the projected return.

1-	We need to identify the investment types: cryptocurrencies, lending in cryptocurrencies, stocks.
2-	Incorporating real time prices for cryptocurrencies & stocks.
3-	Creating a return, duration and risk levels of lending.
